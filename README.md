# 👋 Hi, I'm Samuel 

I'm a 20-year-old Computer Engineering student at the University of Jaén, focused on turning ideas into functional, scalable software. I'm passionate about creating tools that simplify people’s lives—whether it's through automation, modern web interfaces, or AI integration.

Currently building my portfolio with meaningful personal projects while developing strong foundations in backend, frontend, and cloud development. I aim to work on products that are useful, impactful, and actually solve real-world problems.

## 💡 What I Do

I enjoy working across the full stack, combining clean frontend design with robust backend systems. I'm especially interested in:

- ✅ Building full-stack web apps with modern frameworks  
- 🤖 Integrating AI into user-focused applications  
- ⚙️ Automating repetitive tasks and processes with Python  
- 🧩 Designing scalable APIs and database architectures  
- 🧠 Learning by building: real projects with real users in mind  

> My goal is to grow into a senior developer role, while also exploring freelancing and tech consulting in the near future.
