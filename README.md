### üöß Projects in Development

I am currently building a portfolio of data-centric and AI-driven projects. The following will be published on my profile soon:

-   **Social Media Sentiment Analysis:** A tool to analyze opinions on a specific topic using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
-   **Time-Series Forecasting Model:** A project to predict future values (like stock prices or product demand) based on historical data.
-   **Recommendation System:** An implementation of a content recommendation engine (for movies, books, etc.) using collaborative filtering techniques.

*All projects will include comprehensive documentation, clean code, and best practices for version control.*
